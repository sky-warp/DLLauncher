Hi everyone!
This is my first repo and my first pet project in my life.

I just want to slove the problem of "searching games" on your machine and make game expirience more fun. 

What this programm about:
- Its launchins command-line (hope I will switch on GUI and make Desktop version) and prompt user to enter the game name.
- When the name is prompted - game starts, simple.

Now its working only with "alias" (you need to specifie name which will be associate with executable path) - so user need to enter certain commands not whatever he wants. For now, you can see the example of launching VALVe Deadlock game. I also noticed the difference between launching Steam games and non-Steam games. 
Obviously, it make this programm more rigid, because you need to always remember certain command for certain game.
Treat it like pre-pre-pre-pre version of final programm.

This is only the begining. Most of all do it for myself to track the progress of my skills. Anyway, I'll be appreciated for any criticism and help. 
See ya.

*P.S.*
*Sry for my ENG*
