Hi everyone!
This is my first repo and my first pet project in my life.

I just want to slove the problem of "searching games" on your machine and make game expirience more fun. 

What this programm about:
- Its launchins command-line (hope I will switch on GUI and make Desktop version) and prompt user to enter the game name.
- When the name is prompted - game starts, simple.

For now, it can launch only Steam games, and only if you specify game ID (you can find ID of any Steam game on SteamDB https://steamdb.info/)
Its simple:
  1)Enter gane ID
  2)Enjoy it

This launcher needs a lot of polishing, I knew it, but I know, that step by step I can make a good programm and finish my project, which help me understand C# better and deeply.
Next goal: *Implement feauture that allows user to input game name, so launcher would take SteamDB ID automatically*

This is only the begining. Most of all do it for myself to track the progress of my skills. Anyway, I'll be appreciated for any criticism and help. 
See ya.
